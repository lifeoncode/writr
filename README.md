<h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>To build this application I used the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
    <li>React.JS</li>
    <li>Node.JS</li>
    <li>Express</li>
    <li>MongoDB</li>
</ul>

<h3>React.JS</h3>
<p>For the frontend, I used React, fetching and displaying articles, the login and signup UI, handling user interaction with the application. Basically everyhing the user sees was built using React.</p>

<h3>Node.JS</h3>
<p>I used Node.JS for the backend server-side logic of the application, the processing of user requests and serving the right content.</p>

<h3>Express</h3>
<p>Express is a framework that makes building web servers simple, its build on top of NodeJS. I used it to create routes, middleware and the API layer of the application</p>

<h3>MongoDB</h3>
<p>For the database layer, I used mongoDB because it comes with Atlas, which is a cloud platform for creating and hosting databases</p>
